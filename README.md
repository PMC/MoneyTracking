# Money Tracker

## Introduction

This is a project that aims to create a user-friendly money tracking application. The program allows users to manage their finances by recording transactions, categorizing expenses, and analyzing spending patterns.

## Features

- Record transactions: Users can log daily expenses, deposits, or withdrawals.
- Categorize expenses: Transactions can be categorized based on type (e.g., groceries, entertainment, bills).
- Analyze spending patterns: The program provides insights into where the user's money is going, helping them make informed financial decisions.

**Functionality**

*   **AbstractAccountBuilder.cs**: This class serves as a base for all account builders. It provides methods for setting an account name, account ID, and building the final account object.
*   **BankAccountBuilder.cs**: This class inherits from `AbstractAccountBuilder` and overrides the `Build()` method to create a bank account. It also provides a static method `Empty()` to create a new instance of the builder.
*   **PersonAccountBuilder.cs**: Similar to `BankAccountBuilder`, this class creates a person account by overriding the `Build()` method.
*   **TransactionBuilder.cs**: This class demonstrates how to build transactions using the Builder pattern. It allows setting an account ID, transaction date, and building the final transaction object.

**Builder Pattern**

The Builder pattern is used extensively throughout the program. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for more flexibility and easier maintenance.

*   **Step-by-Step Construction**: The builder classes provide methods to set individual properties (e.g., account name, ID) in a step-by-step manner.
*   **Fluent Interface**: The builders use a fluent interface to allow chaining method calls, making the code more readable and concise.
*   **Final Product**: The `Build()` method returns the final constructed object.
