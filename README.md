**Overview**

The program is designed to demonstrate various design patterns in software development. It consists of three main classes: `AbstractAccountBuilder`, `BankAccountBuilder`, and `PersonAccountBuilder`. The program allows users to create different types of accounts (bank or person) using the Builder pattern.

**Functionality**

*   **AbstractAccountBuilder.cs**: This class serves as a base for all account builders. It provides methods for setting an account name, account ID, and building the final account object.
*   **BankAccountBuilder.cs**: This class inherits from `AbstractAccountBuilder` and overrides the `Build()` method to create a bank account. It also provides a static method `Empty()` to create a new instance of the builder.
*   **PersonAccountBuilder.cs**: Similar to `BankAccountBuilder`, this class creates a person account by overriding the `Build()` method.
*   **TransactionBuilder.cs**: This class demonstrates how to build transactions using the Builder pattern. It allows setting an account ID, transaction date, and building the final transaction object.

**Builder Pattern**

The Builder pattern is used extensively throughout the program. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for more flexibility and easier maintenance.

*   **Step-by-Step Construction**: The builder classes provide methods to set individual properties (e.g., account name, ID) in a step-by-step manner.
*   **Fluent Interface**: The builders use a fluent interface to allow chaining method calls, making the code more readable and concise.
*   **Final Product**: The `Build()` method returns the final constructed object.

# Account Builder Design Pattern

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of the Builder design pattern in C#. It consists of classes for creating bank and person accounts, as well as transactions.

## Usage

To create a new account, simply call the `Empty()` method on the desired builder class and chain the necessary methods to set properties. Finally, call the `Build()` method to obtain the constructed object.

### Example (Bank Account)

```csharp
var bankAccount = BankAccountBuilder.Empty()
    .WithName("John Doe")
    .WithAccountID(Guid.NewGuid())
    .Build();
```

## Design Patterns Used

*   **Builder Pattern**: Separates construction and representation, allowing for more flexibility.
*   **Fluent Interface**: Chaining method calls to improve readability.

# Design Patterns Used in Account Builder Project

## Introduction

In this mini-project, we applied various design patterns to create a robust and maintainable system for building accounts. In this section, we'll delve into the specific patterns used and how they work.

### 1. Builder Pattern

*   **Problem**: Construction of complex objects can be error-prone and difficult to manage.
*   **Solution**: Use the Builder pattern to separate construction from representation.
*   **Example**: The `AbstractAccountBuilder` class demonstrates this pattern by providing methods for setting individual properties in a step-by-step manner.

### 2. Fluent Interface

*   **Problem**: Chaining method calls can be cumbersome and hard to read.
*   **Solution**: Use a fluent interface to improve readability and conciseness.
*   **Example**: The `BankAccountBuilder` class uses a fluent interface to allow chaining method calls, making the code more readable.

## Conclusion

The design patterns used in this project have improved the overall maintainability and flexibility of the system. By applying these principles, we've created a robust foundation for future development.

**UML Diagram**

To generate a UML diagram, you can use tools like Visio or Online UML Diagram Tools. Here's an example of what the UML diagram could look like:

```uml
@startuml
class AbstractAccountBuilder {
    +accountName: string?
    +transactionFile: string?
    +accountId: Guid
    +WithAccountID(accountId: Guid): AbstractAccountBuilder
    +WithName(name: string): AbstractAccountBuilder
    +Build(): Account
}

class BankAccountBuilder extends AbstractAccountBuilder {
    +Build(): BankAccount
}

class PersonAccountBuilder extends AbstractAccountBuilder {
    +Build(): PersonAccount
}

class TransactionBuilder {
    +WithAccountID(accountId: Guid): TransactionBuilder
    +SetTransactionDate(date: DateTime): TransactionBuilder
    +Build(): Transaction
}

```

This UML diagram represents the classes and their relationships, making it easier to understand the design of the system.


The code you provided consists of three main classes:

1. **AbstractAccountBuilder.cs**: This class serves as the base class for all account builders, providing common functionality such as setting an account ID or name, and allowing for creating subclasses that build specific types of accounts (e.g., BankAccounts).

2. **PersonAccountBuilder.cs**: As a subclass of AbstractAccountBuilder, this class is responsible for building PersonAccounts. It overrides the Build() method to return a new instance of PersonAccount with the provided account ID and name.

3. **BankAccountBuilder.cs**: Another subclass of AbstractAccountBuilder, BankAccountBuilder builds BankAccounts. Its Build() method creates a new BankAccount using the specified account ID and name.

The functionality of these classes lies in their ability to build different types of accounts by providing specific implementations for each type (e.g., PersonAccounts or BankAccounts). The Builder pattern is used here as a creational design pattern, allowing you to construct complex objects step-by-step instead of relying on constructors with many parameters. It helps improve code readability and maintainability while making it easier to change the implementation details.

I will create a README.md file for your GitHub repository that briefly describes the functionality provided by these classes and how they use the Builder pattern. Additionally, I'll include an overview of the patterns used (i.e., Creational Design Patterns) and explain their workings in more detail for the presentation section. This information should help others understand the code better and provide insights into its design choices.

Remember to place your README.md file at the root directory of your GitHub repository so it can be easily accessible to anyone who visits the project's page.
