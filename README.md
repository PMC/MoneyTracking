# MoneyTracking


I need a Transaction class, each transaction is like a history and contains:

(withdraw or deposit)
amount
toAccountNR
transactionDate (only date, no time)
transactionMessage

you should implement fluent builder pattern to generate a single transaction and then add it to a list


withdraw
deposit

payment between you and <>

received
- date
- message
- amount


sent
- date
- message
- amount



History
           Payments between you and
             FirstName LastName

9 dec
Message             -400
--
9 dec
Message             -400
